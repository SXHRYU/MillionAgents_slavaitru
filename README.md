# MillionAgents task

The task was to parse any [detmir](https://www.detmir.ru/) catalogue with more than 500 items in it and process the data into a CSV. I decided to take [dolls]("https://www.detmir.ru/catalog/index/name/modelnye_kukly/") with 2500+ entries. For more on task you can look at `task.png`.

## Navigation

- `main.py`: main script that launches the parsing.
- `request_data.py`: request headers and initial URL to request. **Do not change the headers! Otherwise there is a possibility of getting banned by the detmir.ru server!**
- `dolls.csv`: the resulting file with parsed data.
